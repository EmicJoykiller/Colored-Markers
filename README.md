Project Description: Colored Markers

Overview:
The "Colored Markers" project is a visual representation of markers in different colors created using HTML and CSS. It simulates three markers (red, green, and blue) with distinct designs for their caps and sleeves, showcasing gradients and box shadows for added realism.

Main Features and Design:

HTML Structure:
The HTML document follows a basic structure with a doctype declaration, <html> and <head> elements containing metadata, and a <body> section for content display.
The content includes an <h1> heading "CSS Color Markers" and a <div> container with three marker elements inside.
Marker Elements:
Each marker is represented by a <div> with a class of "marker" along with specific color classes (red, green, blue).
Each marker has a cap (<div class="cap">) and a sleeve (<div class="sleeve">) nested inside it, defining its structure.
CSS Styling:
The CSS file (styles.css) provides styling for various elements.
The .container class sets the background color and padding for the marker container.
The .marker class defines the dimensions and margin for each marker.
The .cap and .sleeve classes style the cap and sleeve elements with specific dimensions and background colors.
Marker Colors and Effects:
The red marker (<div class="marker red">) uses a linear gradient background from dark red to lighter red, with a box shadow for a 3D effect.
The green marker (<div class="marker green">) features a gradient from dark green to light green, accompanied by a green box shadow.
The blue marker (<div class="marker blue">) showcases a gradient from dark blue to light blue, with a blue box shadow.
Responsive Design:
The design is responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes while maintaining the marker's visual appeal and structure.
The use of relative units and responsive properties ensures the markers adapt well across devices.
Target Audience:
The "Colored Markers" project targets web developers, designers, and enthusiasts interested in learning and experimenting with CSS styling techniques, gradients, box shadows, and responsive design principles.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to:

Showcase CSS capabilities in creating visually appealing marker designs with different colors.
Demonstrate the use of gradients, box shadows, and responsive layout techniques.
Provide a hands-on example for learning and practicing CSS styling for realistic visual elements.
Overall, the "Colored Markers" project serves as a creative and educational resource for exploring CSS styling possibilities in web development.
